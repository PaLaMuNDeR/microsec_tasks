I personally am a supporter of Containers as a solution to scalability. It resolves a lot of problems occurring with
operating systems, migrations and even transferring projects from one service to another. Every project has to be seen
n more details, in order to make decisions about changing the architecture, of course, but my general preference is
Docker (Swarm) and Kubernetes. They are supported on all the major cloud providers and once created are easy to set up
even on VPS. For each server could be declared the number of tasks to be running, so this is good solution for
scalability.
For what regards the different components of the system - I have experienced problems with MariaDB as MySQL databases
do not run along very well with Django (not as much as Postgres for example). Abstracting myself from the technology,
though, there are various solutions for data storage and buckets across the different cloud providers.

Surely, AWS is a leader in its industry and the community supporting it is quite vast. From pricing point of view it is
also competing well. Azure, Google Cloud and IBM are not yet at the level of services, according to various studies I
had run for my previous projects. From both pricing and service point of view AWS is a definite leader, but not every
project requires the same architecture and services, so it is surely not an universal solution.
